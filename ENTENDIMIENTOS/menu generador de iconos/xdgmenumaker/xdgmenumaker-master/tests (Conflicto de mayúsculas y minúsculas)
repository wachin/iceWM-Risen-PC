When running:

    make test

it's normal that you'll get the tests that produce menus with icons to
report FAIL. You really shouldn't worry about those, as the only way to
make them report PASS would be for you to use the exact same icon theme
I'm using and have the same applications installed in your system, which
you most probably don't. These tests are meant mostly for my own testing.
