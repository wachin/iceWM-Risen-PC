The startup script is not provided by the icewm package so you will need to create it yourself.

$ touch ~/.icewm/startup
$ chmod +x ~/.icewm/startup

Then open the file in your favourite text editor and add the commands for the programs that you wish to start with the IceWM session.
Note: Startup commands that install system tray applets must be preceded by sleep 1 &&, otherwise IceWM will create an ugly black window that will prevent it from quitting; in that case, use xkill on the task bar.

Below is an example of an IceWM startup script which starts network-manager-applet and XScreenSaver with the IceWM session:
~/.icewm/startup

#!/bin/bash

sleep 1 &&
nm-applet &

xscreensaver -nosplash &
