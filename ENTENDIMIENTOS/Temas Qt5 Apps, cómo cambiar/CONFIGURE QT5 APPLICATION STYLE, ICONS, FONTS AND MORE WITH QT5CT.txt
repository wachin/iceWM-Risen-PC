CONFIGURE QT5 APPLICATION STYLE, ICONS, FONTS AND MORE WITH QT5CT
http://www.webupd8.org/2015/11/configure-qt5-application-style-icons.html

sudo add-apt-repository ppa:nilarimogard/webupd8
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install qt5ct

Once installed, there's one more step you need to follow or else the settings you apply using Qt5ct won't be applied - you need to open ~/.profile with a text editor (".profile" is a hidden file in your home directory so use CTRL + H to show hidden files) and at the bottom of this file, add the following line:


export QT_QPA_PLATFORMTHEME="qt5ct" 


Then, save the file, log out and after you login you can use Qt5 Configuration Tool to change the Qt5 style, icon theme and so on. Launch

qt5ct

You'll need to restart any Qt5 applications that were running to see the changes.

If later on you want to revert the changes, simply remove the "export QT_QPA_PLATFORMTHEME=qt5ct" line from your ~/.profile file and restart your session (logout).


Important: in some desktop environments / Linux distributions, the QT_QPA_PLATFORMTHEME (or QT_STYLE_OVERRIDE) environment variable might already be set. For instance, Xubuntu sets QT_STYLE_OVERRIDE in /etc/X11/Xsession.d/56xubuntu-session (so you'll need to comment it out to be able to use Qt5ct). LXDE hardcodes this so the only way around it is to compile the code yourself - see HERE.
