 http://tehpost.blogspot.com/2008/03/icewm-change-number-of-workspaces.html?m=1
 
 
By IceWM default loads four virtual desktops ( aka Workspaces). If you want to adjust this setting open your ~/.icewm/preferences file and look for this line :

    WorkspaceNames=" 1 ", " 2 ", " 3 ", " 4 "


Adjust that according to your needs then restart IceWM for the changes to take effect.
