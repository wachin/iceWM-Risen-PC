Some of you might remember this thread:

No?  You don't?  I do ….  ;D

Truth be told I never got it right to have a wallpaper slideshow running on Lxde.

Since Phoenix runs perfectly right now I went back to my Lxde install to fiddle and see what else I can break.  In a moment of weakness I went back to the wallpaper slideshow problem.

I googled again and struck gold in the Mint forum.

So here is how you get a wallpaper slideshow going in PCLinuxLXDE (Mini):

1. You need to create a location where you have all your wallpapers which you want to use.  
    In my setup it is /home/longtom/Wallpapers .
2. Open Leafpad in Menu > Editors
3. In leafpad enter the following:

   
Code: [Select]



#!/bin/bash

DIR=/home/longtom/Wallpapers/
FLOOR=1
RANGE=`ls -1 "$DIR"/*.jpg | wc | awk '// {print $1}'`

number=0

while [ 1 -eq 1 ]; do
  
   number=$RANDOM
   while [ "$number" -le $FLOOR ]; do
        number=$RANDOM
   done
   let "number %= $RANGE"  # Scales $number down within $RANGE.
   COUNTER=1
   for X in "$DIR"/*.jpg
   do
      if [ $number -eq $COUNTER ]; then
         pcmanfm --set-wallpaper "$X"
      fi
   COUNTER=$(($COUNTER+1))
   done
   COUNTER=1
   sleep 10m
done




You can change the time interval by changing the number in the line:
Code: [Select]

  sleep 10m


As you can see, mine is set to 10 minutes.

This script works only for jpg files as it stands but you can add other formats at will.

Also make sure that you replace longtom in
Code: [Select]

DIR=/home/longtom/Wallpapers


with your home folder's name.

Save your file in your "/home/user" folder.  I chose the name rotator.

In PCmanFM find your file, right click on it, choose "Properties > Permissions" and tick next to "Make the file executable".

Left click on your file and choose "Execute"

There she runs.

You can add this script to your LXDE autostart script.

One more thing.  If you only log out and back in you might suddenly have 2 sessions of this script running.  We don't want that.
In order to make sure our script stops when we log out we add the following line to our ".bashrc" in the /home/user directory:

Code: [Select]

alias lxlogout='killall -9 rotator | exit 0 && lxsession-logout'


That is it.  Test it and enjoy a new scenery on your desktop every so often to make life more colourful.
