How to change keyboard layouts in Openbox, Icewm, Razor-qt ...

Many people suffer from a problem with switching between keyboard layouts in lightweight desktop environments or lightweight window managers like ***box family, Icewm, E17 etc...

The problem does not seem to be that hard if you looked wisely, with this simple command, you can solve that problem so easily :

setxkbmap -option grp:switch,grp:alt_shift_toggle,grp_led:Â­scroll us,fr

You see, I chosen French and English American to switch from, you can choose you own.

And the keys we hint to change the keyboard layout are : ALT+SHIFT, of course you chose what you like.

Changes are temporary, we need to perform this command in every session , so it will be painful.
To make changes permanent, we have to put the command in .bashrc which is located in the Home directory.

nano .bashrc

Now, paste the command in that file, and press  CTRL+O to save, then  CTRL+X to exit.

Enjoy !
