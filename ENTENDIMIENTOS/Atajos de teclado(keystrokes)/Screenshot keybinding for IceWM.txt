Screenshot keybinding for IceWM
https://bbs.archlinux.org/viewtopic.php?id=135172

Hello guys!
This is the script /all/script-screenshot.sh:

#!/bin/bash

DATE=`date +%s`
scrot "$HOME/downloads/scr-$DATE.png"
And this is from ~/.icewm/keys:
key "Print"   /all/script-screenshot.sh


When no IceWM menus are open - it works. But if I want to make a screenshot with some IceWM menu, keybinding won't work. Is there anything I can do to make it capture screen with menus?

Just to say it also happens to me.
Not much of a help, I know, but the mailing lists really don't help also.
I think we should forget ~/.icewm/keys, and use an alternative, f.e. xbindkeys.
