http://www.icewm.org/FAQ/IceWM-FAQ-9.html

What if you are running an application and need to use a keystroke that is grabbed by IceWM?

Marko suggests the following workaround:

    Activate scroll lock
    Do problematic key stroke
    Deactivate scroll lock

He advises that this will only work if "ScrollLock" is set up as a modifier.

Here is how to use the X11 xmodmap utility to setup ScrollLock as a modifier (from Marco Molteni):

    check which modifiers are free:

            $ xmodmap -pm

            xmodmap:  up to 2 keys per modifier, (keycodes in parentheses):

            shift       Shift_L (0x32),  Shift_R (0x3e)
            lock        Caps_Lock (0x42)
            control     Control_L (0x25),  Control_R (0x6d)
            mod1        Alt_L (0x40),  Alt_R (0x71)
            mod2        Num_Lock (0x4d)
            mod3
            mod4        Super_L (0x73),  Super_R (0x74)
            mod5      

    in this example mod3 is free, so we bind the ScrollLock key to it:

           $ xmodmap -e "add mod3 = Scroll_Lock"

    this invocation of xmodmap should be put in the script that starts the window manager, for example $HOME/.xinit or $HOME/.xsession, see Howto make IceWM default WM for more detailed info about startup of WM or use IceWM's startup.
